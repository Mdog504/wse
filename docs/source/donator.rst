Doesn't work. Attempting to edit will unformat sign text if formatted before.

Painting scroll
--------

Shift and right click a painting.
Then use the scroll wheel to scroll through the available paintings.

Coloured name
--------

By selecting a donator tag, you also have the ability to change the colour of your name.
To do this, simply run ``/tags`` and select a donator tag (Donator, 420, UwU, Senpai).
After selecting your tag, another menu will come up with colours on them. From here, select the colour you wish your name to be.

Personal Time
--------

This allows you to visually see a different time of day from the rest of the server.
Simply do ``/ptime <option>`` to set it.

Current options:
  * Freeze - Pauses the daylight cycle.
  * Unfreeze - Resumes the daylight cycle.
  * Day - Sets time to day.
  * Night - Sets time to night.
  * Dusk - Sets time to dusk.
  * Morning - Sets time to morning.
  * Realtime - Sets your time to the server's time.
  * Reset - Resyncs you with standard server time.

.. warning:: Having your personal time as day will not stop mobs from spawning and attacking you when it is night for everyone else.

Helpful Extras
--------

These commands, whilst not doing much, help make your life more efficient on the server.

These include:

`/besttools` - Automatically selects the best tool for doing what you are doing (e.g. an axe will be automatically selected when chopping wood)

`/refill` - Automatically replenishes resources into your hand from your inventory when you run out. 

`/chestsort` - Automatically places items into a neat order inside a container.

You can also open a double door as if it was one door!

Punch Staff
--------
Anyone with UwU rank or above has the ability to punch Jr. Mods, Mods, bAdmins and Owners.
Simply punch them to send them to the skies!

.. note:: The UwU rank or above is needed for this perk!, and staff may opt out of this if they want to!
