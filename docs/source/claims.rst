In this area no one else is able to break, place or interact with any blocks except it is a `trusted player <https://docs.worstserverever.com/en/latest/claims.html#trust-player>`_.
You can right click a corner with a wooden shovel to change the size.

.. warning:: Entities such as cows, villagers, cats, etc. are **NOT** protected by a claim!
    Please open a `player report ticket <https://docs.worstserverever.com/en/latest/ticket%20system.html#player-member-reports>`_ if your pets were killed.
