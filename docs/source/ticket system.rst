Support Tickets 
--------

Something wrong with the server? Have a really interesting question (that HASN'T been answered in a public channel)? Found a bug/would like to discuss something with staff?
Well then support tickets are here for YOU!

.. warning::
    Before making a ticket, ask yourself if a regular member can answer your question. If so, the `#community-help <https://canary.discord.com/channels/776986519910875168/936561352003158036>`_ channel is for you!

To make a ticket go to `#make-a-ticket <https://canary.discord.com/channels/776986519910875168/835936704380272701>`_ on our `Discord server <https://discord.worstserverever.com>`_ and press the support ticket button. Then tell us what you need help with. If the issue involves an in-game issue please provide relevant information (like coordinates and usernames).

.. note:: Tickets that remain inactive or contain rude behavior will be closed. 

Player/Member Reports
--------

Joined one day and your favourite wooden plank is missing or you met one of those no-life steam scam imposters on Discord? Then come on down to a player/member report!
Player/Member reports allow you to communicate one on one with moderators.
You DO NOT need to know who the culprit is to open a player report (we can easily figure out who it was).

.. note:: You will not be told who the culprit was under normal circumstances.

.. warning:: It may sometimes take us a long time to get this information. Please do not pressure us and instead provide coordinates and possible names immediately so we can do our searches easily.

Purchase Support
--------

.. warning:: Before opening one of these wait **at least 30 minutes** for your purchase to process.

A ticket to discuss missing purchase rewards with owners.
Service on these may be slower then usual due to there only being 2 owners, but be assured we have received your ticket and will respond as soon as possible.
Please be sure to describe your purchase in the ticket.

Staff Report/Ban Appeal
----

| "That ban wasn't justified!"
Here is where you appeal for a ban or report the actions of a staff member.
Only bAdmins and Owners can see these types of tickets and they will be handled as soon as possible.
Please be sure to state the reasons as to why the action of a staff member wasn't fair.

.. note:: Unbans are not freely handed out for making this ticket.
