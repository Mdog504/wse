Linking
=====

Link Discord and Minecraft accounts
--------

To link you Discord and Minecraft accounts, run ``/dlink`` in game.
This will generate a 4 digit code which is sent in chat to you.
Then DM the Worst Server Ever bot on discord (Name: 'Worst Server Ever#9344') with the code.
If you have done this correctly, your accounts will be linked and you will recieve a discord tag in-game.

Link Java and Bedrock accounts
--------

Before you link your accounts, please ensure you have stored the inventory of your bedrock account somewhere safe as it will be lost when they are linked.

The easiest way to link your Java and Bedrock accounts is by joining the linking server.
The IP for this server is: ``link.geysermc.org``
Bedrock port: ``19132``
Java port: ``25565``

Once you have joined on both accounts, run the command ``/linkaccount`` on one of the accounts.
This generates a random number which is messaged to you.
Then on the other account run ``/linkaccount <code>``

Your accounts are now linked!
