Tags
====

Tags go before your username in both chat and the tab list.

Set tag
--------

| To set your tag, run ``/tags``.
This will open up an interface in which you can select your tag.
To apply it, simply click on the tag (some versions of bedrock may require you to select it and move it to another inventory slot).

Remove tag
--------

| To remove your tag, run ``/tags``.
At the bottom of the interface is a player head item that removes the current equipped tag when clicked
(once again some bedrock versions may have to move the head to another slot).
