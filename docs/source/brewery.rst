Fermenting
--------

The first step in making a drink is to ferment the raw ingredients. To do so, follow the following steps:

1. Place cauldron over heat source and fill it with water

2. Add the ingredients by right clicking the cauldron

3. Wait the specified time said in the recipe

4. Fill glass bottles with the fermented liquid by right clicking the cauldron

All drinks have the same color on bedrock.

.. note:: You can use a clock to see how long the fermentation has been going on.

Distilling
--------

Not all recipes require fermentation.
To ferment:

1. Place the bottles into a brewing stand

2. Place glowstone dust into the top of the brewing stand - this will not be used up

Ageing
--------

**Small barrel** | 9 Slots

Attach a spigot (fence) and a sign that has "Barrel" written on it:

Message "Barrel created" should appear.
.. note:: You may remove the sign from the Big Barrel after creating it.

To open a barrel, simply right click it.
Each Minecraft day represents 1 year.
Each recipe requires a different type of wood for the barrel to be made of and the time it should be aged for.
The standard Minecraft barrel is an oak barrel.

Drinking
--------

When drank by the player, the amount of alcohol inside the brew will make the player slightly drunk.
Different levels of drunkenness have different effects on the player.

The Player may not be able to walk normally anymore, he will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight.
Effects like Blindness, Confusion, Poison etc. occur.

The chat will be altered depending on drunkenness, many things players write may be incomprehensible, sometimes it seems senseless.

If the alcohol is particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects.

After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting.

When logging off, the player may have difficulties reaching his character, thus some logins shortly after may be denied.

After overdrinking, the player may faint (this will kick you).

Sealing drinks
--------

You may wish to seal your drink in order to be able to sell it.
To do this simply craft a "Brew Sealing Table" as seen below.

This table will equalise the brew so that it is equal to similarly brewed drinks.
Sealed brews cannot be aged more or modified in any way.

Getting sober
--------

After getting drunk, it takes time for the drunkenness level to drop.
Alternatively you can use milk to speed this up.

Other effects
--------

When logging off extremely drunk it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, they will find themselves at a completely unknown place in the middle of nowhere, having no idea how they got there.

But if they log back in after some hours or the next morning, they will find themselves at their /home, again without any memories.

Also if the alcohol was not of best quality, the player may face some bad type of hangover (slowness and hunger).
